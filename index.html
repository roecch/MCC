    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    
    <p>Throughout the COVID pandemic, companies that developed vaccines saw a surge 
      in their stock prices while many others suffered a decline. The purpose of this 
      project is to analyze the relative price performance of six different vaccine/medical 
      device companies. The primary objective is to utilize historical price data to uncover 
      trends/correlations amidst the companies. We plan on accomplishing this by graphing 
      the price data against other statistical measures such as volume (the number of shares
       traded during market hours).</p>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    
    <p>The visualization on the left is a line chart, where each company corresponds to a line. 
      In the legend, we have 6 companies all with a coresponding color. There is a filter where you can choose
      between open, close, high, low, adjusted close price and the line chart will update. When you
    hover over the line, the company name, date, and current price will show. </p>

    <p>The visualization on the right is a bar chart. Each company has a bar corresponding to the total 
      volume of stock. We used different color encodings to differentiate the bars. There is brushing and linking between the bar chart
	and the line chart. You can click on a bar, and the corresponding line will highlight in the line chart. If you 
	  select multiple bars, then multiple lines will be selected.</p>
